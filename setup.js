By Max the Demon Cat

For most, the Great Fire of London was a tragedy. For me, it was Tuesday.

I had been living in the city for about 600 years by then, and honestly, the place was getting a bit stale. The humans were so predictable - always rebuilding the same buildings, making the same mistakes. I needed some excitement.

So when that baker on Pudding Lane left his oven on overnight, I may have... encouraged the flames a bit. Just a little demonic nudge here and there. Nothing major.

The fire spread faster than anyone expected, consuming 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, and the old St. Paul's Cathedral. The humans were devastated, but I was having the time of my life watching them scurry around like ants.

Of course, I didn't start the fire. That would be irresponsible. I just... made it more interesting. The humans needed a lesson in fire safety anyway.

The rebuilding took years, and I got to watch the city transform. New buildings, new opportunities for chaos. It was quite educational, really.

And before you ask - no, I don't feel guilty. The humans learned valuable lessons about fire prevention, and I got some excellent entertainment. Everyone wins.

Except for the baker. He definitely lost. But that's what you get for leaving your oven on.
