Max the Demon Cat - Short Story

It was 3:00 AM, the hour when shadows stretch and silence feels alive. 
Max sat perched on the dresser, his glowing green eyes locked on his human. 
With one paw, he tapped the glass of water just enough to make it wobble. 
The human stirred, half awake. "Max... don't you dare." 

The paw struck. The glass toppled. Water splashed across the floor. 
Max grinned, his tiny horns catching the moonlight. 
"Chaos is best served cold," he muttered, though only the darkness heard. 

Satisfied, he leapt down, tail flicking like a whip, and vanished into the hallway. 
The human sighed, already knowing tomorrow’s chaos would begin with the missing car keys. 
Max always hid them—but never in the same place twice. 
After all, what’s the fun in torment if it’s predictable?
